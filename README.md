# Partisan Perspectives: Testing Differences in Political Attitudes with R

### Project Overview

This project aims to determine whether statistically and practically significant differences exist between Democratic and Republican voters’ views on college professors and public-school curricula. It employs assumption evaluations, hypothesis testing, and effect size evaluations on data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) organization. 

### Tools

R-Studio | Hypothesis Tests (Welch's and Wilcoxon rank-sum) | Effect Size Measures (Cohen's D and Cliff's Delta)

### Process

1. Cleaned and selected relevant variables from the ANES dataset; ensured test assumptions (e.g., independence, normality) were met.
2. Applied Welch’s t-test and Cohen's D to evaluate party differences in rating of college professors.
3. Applied Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cliff's Delta for ordinal responses on importance of school curricula.

### Results

The analysis identified clear, statistically and practically significant ideological differences in trust and value systems between political parties. We found a statistically significant difference in how Democrats and Republicans rated their feelings of "warmth" towards college professors, with a Cohen's D effect size measure of 1.30. Regarding views on the importance of what's being taught in public schools, we observed a practical significance of -0.33 using Cliff's Delta. These results contribute to the broader conversations around political polarization in education discourse. 

### Key Learnings

1. Developed fluency in matching statistical tests to data types and assumptions.
2. Reinforced the value of effect size interpretation alongside p-values for real-world impact.
3. Strengthened ability to derive defensible insights from complex, nationally representative survey data.
